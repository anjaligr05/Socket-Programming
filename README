     Included files for submission:
     a. util.h :   Includes all library header files and global constants.
     b. server450.h: Contains the linked list data structure required to stor server neighbor information 
     c. client.c: Contains client's functionality
     d. serverA.c: Contains serverA's functionality
     e. serverB.c: Contains serverB's functionality
     f. serverC.c: Contains serverC's functionality
     g. serverD.c: Contains serverD's functionality
     
     Work done: Create a "client.c", "serverA.c", "serverB.c" , "serverC.c", "serverD.c" files to simulate Dikjstra's shortest path algorithm.
     The client and four servers communicate through TCP and UDP sockets to share network topology and compute the MST of the graph.
     
     Steps for Build:
     
     Please run make command to create four executables: client, serverA, serverB, serverC and serverD
     These executables can be run to find the shortest minimum spanning tree of the graph.
     
     Format for all messages:
     All messages are printed as per the project specification
     
     The program includes beej socket programming tutorial and adopts the minimum spanning tree prim's algorithm.
